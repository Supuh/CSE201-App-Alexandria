                        Welcome to App Alexandria!

Hopefully all of your questions can be answered here, but if there are any issues
or outstanding questions about the program, please contact the Ptolemarchs team
at [parker86@miamioh.edu]


*  How do I create an account?

Entering a username and password in the indicated "Sign-up" field on the login screen
will enter you into our database. From there, this same information can be entered
in the "Login" field to access App Alexandria.


* What if I don't want to make an account?

We are sorry to say App Alexandria does not support guest accounts in its current state.
This is a feature we have debated on adding in the past and may revisit in the future, but
in the meantime, we recommend creating an account. It's free after all!


* How do I submit app requests?

We love expanding our library! By pressing the "Click here to submit an app to App Alexandria" 
button located at the bottom of App Alexandria's main page, you can access a page which allows 
you to enter app information. Should your request submit, an admin will either accept or deny
your request.

* I've found X bug while using your platform, how do I handle this?

Simply contact our team at [parker86@miamioh.edu] to report any suspected bugs. We assure you that
customer satisfaction is our priority and will do our best to get you up and running again!
