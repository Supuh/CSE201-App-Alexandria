Group 1 - The Ptolemarchs
Dylan Parker (Project Manager), Ethan Tobin (Technical Manager), Zhifei Ling (Programmer)

Our team consisted of approximately 3 people with varying degrees of coding knowledge. Our
project and (new) technical manager have multiple years of experience in Java as well as
other coding/coding-adjacent languages while our programmer has ~1 year of Java experience.
Our goal in this project was to create a basic GUI using Java that implemented various
functionalities (search, filter, login, etc.) using a txt document database system and code.

From a learning perspective, we hoped to gain newfound understanding of and familiarity with
Java and the software engineering norms associated with group programming efforts. Making new,
interconnected usage of Java's classes and database systems was also a new endeavor we hoped
to gain ground on.

Having met each and every objective we set for ourselves through the requirements, diagrams, 
and charts we completed (save that which the TA removed); we have likely succeeded in reaching 
those goals of newfound understanding and consider this project a success.
